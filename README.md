# alpha-decay-detection-system
The Alpha Decay Detection System is a statistical tool designed to monitor quantitative trading strategies and detect when a trading signal has stopped working. Since markets evolve and strategies get copied, alpha eventually shrinks. This Python-based Jupyter Notebook extracts historical alpha using a Rolling OLS regression against Fama-French factors, applies Bayesian Online Change-Point Detection (BOCD) to identify structural regime shifts, and utilizes survival analysis to estimate the remaining half-life and survival probability of the signal.
